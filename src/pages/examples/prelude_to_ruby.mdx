# Prelude to ruby

Ruby is a **functional**, **object-oriented**, **interpreted** language. It draws programming concepts from C, Simula, Lisp and Python. 
It was created by _Yakoshi Natsamuto_. The first version was released in 1993; since then it has drawn a lot of developers.

```ruby

# Printing hello world
puts("Hello, world!")

# Variable assignment
a = 1
b = 2
# parentheses around functions are optional in ruby
puts a + b

# arithmetic operation
puts 1 + 2 # add
puts 100 - 90 # subtract
puts 23 * 11 # multiply
puts 34/2 # divide
puts 18 % 3 # modulo

# floating point operation
puts Math::PI * 9 # area of a circle
puts Math::E # Floating point constant of the Euler number

# String operations
a = "Ruby"
b = "Programming"
puts a + b

# functions are defined by using the _def_
# _end_ is used to signal the end of the function body
def get_a_number
    return '10'
end
```

Ruby has a strong object-oriented programming foundation. All objects, including primitive types are Objects. All ruby objects
inherit from the ```BasicObject``` instance. 

```ruby
# Object Oriented Programming principles
class Student
    def initialize
        # Instance variables begin with the '@' symbol
        # They are only available to the instance methods (functions of the class)
        @first_name = "Alan"
        @last_name = "Turing" 
    end

    # Static methods, aka methods that can be called without creating an instance, are
    # created by prepending _self_ identifier before the function name
    def self.say_hello
        puts "Hello there!"
    end

    # Instance methods can access the object by using the self keyword
    def full_name
        return @first_name + @last_name
    end
    # private methods are only available to the methods within the class
    private def something_super_secret
    end
end
```
